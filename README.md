# Linuxkill
Behold: The unique *LINUX UNBLOCKER*
Ok,so I figured out that the Opera Browser company made a product called
"Opera Developer".Now,I also knew how to make this code portable to linux.
(For a note,this thing will only work if either linux is unblocked for you,or you are on chrome://version 132 or higher.)
Otherwise,you're cooked.

**Side story:** I have two computers,one is for school,
and one is for home,but I cannot really do anything on the home one 
because they are both synced under the school account.If you have the same problem,Linux will 
probably be unblocked already for you because It is *your* computer 
and It has been auto-updated to chrome://version 130 or something and therefore already has linux.
So,I will say this only once: *opera will only work once linux is unblocked*

**EXPLOIT** 
1 First,go to 
```
chrome://settings/
```
To get to settings.
Now,click your profile picture you see right smack in front of you.
You can't miss it.If you did miss it,you need better glasses.
It should open up an app.That app is called settings.
In the top of the screen,you should see a search bar.
Search "Linux" and scroll to the very bottom.
If you see a "Remove" button instead,then skip to the next step.
If you see a "Install" button,or something like that,click it,and wait until it downloads.
Did it download? Good.Now close those tabs.

2.Now,Download any file that you want from here:
- So,go to the [File Library](https://github.com/Exploit-Master122/Linuxkill/blob/main/linuxlinks.html)
- Type them into the search bar in a new tab,otherwise,they won't download.
- Make sure to drag the link into your bookmarks bar.Spam click it but only as a last resort ***IF IT'S NOT WORKING!!***
- Good boy!! ðŸ˜† =-D



3.Finally,go to files.
- In the files,select "downloads".
Now lick a file called "Opera-developer-setup",or something like that.
Sorry,did I say "lick"? I meant "Click"! Ha!
Select "Open" and wait until it loads.


<p> <dev>
4.Go to your apps.
Select "Opera dev"
Behold: UNRESTRICTED BROWSING!!

***NOTES!!***
There are many browsers that can run on linux.To to the files that I have deployed in the repository.

# FIREFOX BROWS3R
- I deployed a very old version of firefox,around v80 and it BARELY works and is more unstable than my grandfather with a cane.
- But...It works and is completely unblocked!
- Go to [Replit](https://replit.com) and sign in or make an account if you have one already.
- After you made your account, go to [Firefox Download](https://replit.com/@viaangothivreka/Unblocked-Brows3r)
- Remix the Project and navigate to VNC or output.
- Go to the Main.sh,if you know what you're doing... (You probably don't) If you just want to see the browser,and don't want to see the source code,then skip this step.
- In the VNC,Click "Run" and then click "Refresh the connection"
- Make sure you are on port 8001 if the browser crashes.Make sure to go fullscreen.


  # Browser Emulators
  - All of these are pretty lame,but they work well.
