# Linuxkill
Behold: The unique *LINUX UNBLOCKER*
Ok,so I figured out that the Opera Browser company made a product called
"Opera Developer".Now,I also knew how to make this code portable to linux.
(For a note,this thing will only work if either linux is unblocked for you,or you are on chrome://version 129 or higher.)
Otherwise,you're cooked.

**Side story:** I have two computers,one is for school,
and one is for home,but I cannot really do anything on the home one 
because they are both synced under the school account.If you have the same problem,Linux will 
probably be unblocked already for you because It is *your* computer 
and It has been auto-updated to chrome://version 130 or something.
So,I will say this only once: *opera will only work once linux is unblocked*

**EXPLOIT** 
1. First,go to 
```
chrome://settings/
```
To get to settings.
Now,click your profile picture you see right smack in front of you.
You can't miss it.If you did miss it,you need better glasses.
It should open up an app.That app is called settings.
In the top of the screen,you should see a search bar.
Search "Linux" and scroll to the very bottom.
If you see a "Remove" button instead,then skip to the next step.
If you see a "Install" button,or something like that,click it,and wait until it downloads.
Did it download? Good.Now close those tabs.

2.Now,Download this:
```
https://download.opera.com/download/get/?id=70125&location=424&nothanks=yes&sub=marine&utm_tryagain=yes
```
Good boy! (Laughs) ðŸ˜† XD



3.Finally,go to files.
In the files,select "downloads".
Now lick a file called "Opera-developer-setup",or something like that.
Sorry,did I say "lick"? I meant "Click"! Ha!
Select "Open" and wait until it loads.



4.Go to your apps.
Select "Opera dev"
Behold: UNRESTRICTED BROWSING!!

***NOTES!!***
There are many browsers that can run on linux.To to the files that I have to see.
